# Product-Classification-using-Neural-Network-Algorithm

Present a R Markdown document to classify products in fashion industry by applying neural network modelling. In this case, I used neural network tool `mxnet`.
This dataset contains train and test set of 10 different categories for 28 x 28 pixel-sized fashion images, use the following glossary for the target labels: <br />

0 = T-Shirt<br />
1 = Trouser<br />
2 = Pullover<br />
3 = Dress<br />
4 = Coat<br />
5 = Sandal<br />
6 = Shirt<br />
7 = Sneaker<br />
8 = Bag<br />
9 = Boot<br />

The dataset is about product classification and contains 785 variables as following:<br />
**label** and **pixel (named from `pixel1` to `pixel784`)**<br />
(the explanation of these variables is in “Data Explanation” sub-section)
